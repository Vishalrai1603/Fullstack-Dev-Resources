## 📝 Projects

Here are some of the ongoing projects I'm working on as part of my learning journey. These projects will help reinforce the concepts I'm learning and build practical skills.

### Journal-Taking Website 🗒️

**Project Description:**  
Currently, I am building a fullstack Journal-Taking website, where users can create, update, delete, and organize journal entries. The app will allow users to sign up, log in, and access their entries securely.

**Features:**  
- User Authentication (Sign Up, Login)
- Create, Edit, and Delete Journal Entries
- Store Entries with timestamps and categories
- Responsive UI for a smooth experience on all devices

**GitHub Repository:**  
You can follow along and contribute to this project via the [Quick-Project](https://github.com/Vishalrai1603/Quick_project).

This project will help me learn how to handle user authentication, work with databases, manage state in React, and deploy a fullstack app.

**Status:** Work In Progress (WIP)

Feel free to follow along with my progress on this project and contribute any suggestions or improvements!

## 🚧 WIP (Work In Progress)
