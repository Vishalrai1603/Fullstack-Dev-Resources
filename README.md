# Fullstack Developer Series 🚀

Welcome to the **Fullstack Developer Series**! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of notes, tutorials, and projects that I’ve been working on to become a better fullstack developer.

Whether you are a beginner looking to dive into web development or an experienced developer looking for a refresher, this repository is for you. It’s my journey documented, step-by-step, and I’m excited to share it with you!

## 📚 What’s Inside?

This repository will cover all aspects of fullstack development including but not limited to:

- **Frontend Development** 🖥️  
  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and more!

- **Backend Development** 💻  
  Node.js, Express, MongoDB, SQL, and more!

- **APIs & Authentication** 🔐  
  RESTful APIs, JWT, OAuth, and more!

- **Deployment & DevOps** 🚀  
  Docker, AWS, CI/CD pipelines, and more!

- **Version Control** 🧑‍💻  
  Git, GitHub, Gitflow, and more!

And much more as I continue to learn and grow in my journey!

## 🚧 WIP (Work In Progress)

Since this is an ongoing learning process, some notes and projects might still be a work in progress. I encourage you to follow along and contribute! If you see any mistakes or things that could be improved, feel free to open an issue or a pull request!

## 💡 Why I Started This Series

I believe that the best way to learn is by sharing knowledge. As I go through tutorials, build projects, and dive deeper into technologies, I document everything here. I want to build a community where learners, just like me, can grow together. So if you find something helpful, or if you want to add your thoughts or resources, feel free to contribute!
